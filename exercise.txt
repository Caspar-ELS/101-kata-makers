CHAPTER 1: THE CAKE
- I want to be able to make cake
- I want to be able to specify color, types, sizes. At least three of each.
- I want to be able to name my cake which by default should be a composite of its color, types, and sizes
    i.e. "large orange cheese cake"
- If I don't like the default name of a cake, I want to be able to rename it myself
    i.e. "[YOUR_NAME]'s amazing cake"
- I want to be able to get the price of the cake based on the sizes
- Cakes expire, in one hour exactly. I want to be able to check how many more fresh minutes my cake has left.
    I never want to return less than zero.
