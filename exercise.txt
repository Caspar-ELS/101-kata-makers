CHAPTER 1: THE CAKE
- I want to be able to make cake
- I want to be able to specify color, type, size. At least three of each.
- I want to be able to name my cake which by default should be a composite of its color, type, and size
    i.e. "large orange cheese cake"
- If I don't like the default name, I want to be able to rename it myself
    i.e. "Caspar's amazing cake"
- I want to be able to get the price of the cake based on the size
- Cakes expire, in five days exactly. I want to be able to check how many more fresh minutes my cake has left.
    I never want to return less than zero.
    Some cakes unexpectedly expire, for instance if I drop it. I want to be able to set the expiry date to zero in those cases.

CHAPTER 1: THE SHOP
- After making a cake I want to be able to put a cake in my shop, and I want to be able to check how many cakes are in my shop
- When a cake expires, I want to have it automatically removed from my shop
