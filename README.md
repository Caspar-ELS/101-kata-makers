## Application for find file difference

For comparing data with sensitive data, we should try to avoid using any 3rd party tool. As we donâ€™t are they using our data or not, a risk of sensitive data being leaked.

However, something we have to do comparison related to some sensitive data(eg: comparing log / request in production), to solve this problem, we can create a tool by ourselves.

### Requirement:

1. Read two files

2. Compare two files, annotate them if they different

### Roadmap
1. Read two files into the application

2. Find is their any different between lines
 
3. Annotate word that is/are different

4. (Optional) Create UI for using this application

### Expected outcome
Original file:
```
I like Java a lot.
platform platform implement platform platform
This goes great with server.
Java is oops based.
```

Updated file:
```
I like Javascript very very much.
platform platform platform platform plank plank platform platform
Browser loves it.
Javascript is procedural based.
```

Comparison result(`||` is separator between two different version, just for better display):
```
I like [Java a lot.] || I like {Javascript very very much.}
platform platform [implement] platform [platform] || platform platform {platform} platform {plank plank platform platform}
[This goes great with server.] || {Browser loves it.}
[Java] is [oops] based. || {Javascript} is {procedural} based.
```
