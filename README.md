## Application for find file difference

For comparing data with sensitive data, we should try to avoid using any 3rd party tool. As we donâ€™t are they using our data or not, a risk of sensitive data being leaked.

However, something we have to do comparison related to some sensitive data(eg: comparing log / request in production), to solve this problem, we can create a tool by ourselves.
